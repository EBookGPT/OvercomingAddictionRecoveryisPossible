# Chapter 7: Asking for Help

Congratulations on making it this far! You've learned about the negative consequences of addiction and why it's important to break the cycle. At this point, you may feel overwhelmed or unsure about where to turn next. That's where asking for help comes in.

Asking for help can be difficult, especially if you've been struggling with addiction for a long time. You may feel ashamed or like you don't deserve help. However, it's important to remember that addiction is a disease, not a choice, and there is no shame in seeking help.

There are many resources available for those who are ready to ask for help. Support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous can be a great place to start. In these groups, you can connect with people who understand what you're going through and share your own experiences.

Professional help is also available. Addiction counselors and therapists can provide individualized support and guidance as you navigate the recovery process. They can help you develop coping skills, manage cravings, and work through the underlying issues that may have contributed to your addiction in the first place.

Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to admit that you need help and to take the first steps toward recovery. Recovery is possible, and by asking for help, you're taking an important step toward a brighter future.

```python
# Example code for asking for help
def ask_for_help():
  print("I am worth it and it takes strength to ask for help.")
  support_group_location = input("Enter your zip code to find a local support group: ")
  find_support_group(support_group_location)
  therapist_name = input("Enter the name of a therapist you're interested in: ")
  find_therapist(therapist_name)
```

# The Tale of Robin Hood and the Stone Fortress

Once upon a time, Robin Hood found himself in a land where addiction was running rampant. People were struggling to break free from the grip that drugs and alcohol had on them, and Robin Hood knew that something had to be done.

One day, as he was wandering through the forest, he stumbled upon a stone fortress. The fortress was home to many people who were struggling with addiction, and they were all trapped inside, unable to escape.

Robin Hood knew that he had to help these people, but he also knew that he couldn't do it alone. So, he called upon his trusted friends and allies to aid him in his mission.

Together, they came up with a plan to storm the fortress and free the people who were trapped inside. But as they approached the fortress walls, they realized that they would need more than just brute force.

Robin Hood turned to his friends and said, "We need to ask for help. We can't do this alone." And with those words, they set out to find the help they needed.

They sought out local support groups and addiction counselors, who provided them with the tools and resources they needed to successfully storm the fortress. With the help of their new allies, they were able to free the people trapped inside and provide them with the support and guidance they needed to overcome their addiction.

In the end, Robin Hood learned that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. He realized that helping others overcome addiction requires a community effort and that by working together, anything is possible.

```python
# Example code for seeking help
def seek_help():
  print("Asking for help is the first step towards overcoming addiction.")
  support_group_location = input("Enter your zip code to find a local support group: ")
  find_support_group(support_group_location)
  therapist_name = input("Enter the name of a therapist you're interested in: ")
  find_therapist(therapist_name)
  contact_support_hotline()
```
The code used to resolve the Robin Hood story involves functions that enable the user to seek help in overcoming addiction. 

The seek_help() function first reminds the user that asking for help is an important and necessary step towards overcoming addiction. It then prompts the user to enter their zip code to find a local support group. This could include groups like Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. The find_support_group() function should accept the user's location as a parameter and use an API call to retrieve information on support groups in that area. 

Next, the user is asked to input the name of a therapist they're interested in. The find_therapist() function will accept the therapist's name as a parameter and use an API call to retrieve information on that specific therapist, such as their credentials and contact information. This can be helpful for those who prefer one-on-one counseling or therapy sessions.

Finally, the user is prompted to contact a support hotline. This is an important resource for those who may be in crisis or need immediate help. The contact_support_hotline() function should provide the user with the necessary phone numbers and information to get in touch with a support hotline.

Using these functions, the user can seek out the help they need to overcome addiction and begin their journey towards recovery. Seeking help is a sign of strength and one of the most important steps towards recovery.
